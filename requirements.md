# Vision

What is the vision of this product?
- The vision of our product is to allow users to to see, create, update, and delete reviews on games generated through a public API.  

What pain point does this project solve?

the game previously to leave reviews for others to reference.

Why should we care about your product?

give insight on games they are passionate about or games they feel were not up to par.
